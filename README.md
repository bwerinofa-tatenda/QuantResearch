This repo will include some quantitative trading and investing research I've done.  
Algorithmic trading strategies fall in to one of 2 broad categories:
- **Trend following**
- **Mean reverting strategies**.  
In general mean reverting strategies tend to be more profitable than the trend following strategies, this may be due to the 
fact that markets are only trending 20% of the time.  

**Trend following strategies** are those that take advantage of the momentum in a moving asset to trade with the trend, the most 
common trend following strategy is the moving average strategy which buys an asset when it crosses over a moving average of a 
certain period and sells when it crosses below

**Mean reverting strategies** rely on the fact that most price progressions tend to revert back to a mean or expected value, therefore
when the price of an asset or a combination of assets deviates from the mean a program can take on trades to explore this inefficiency.
