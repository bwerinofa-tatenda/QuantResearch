We can proactively create a portfolio of individual price series so that the market value (or price)
series of this portfolio is stationary. This is the notion of cointegration: If we can find a stationary
linear combination of several nonstationary price series, then these price series are called cointegrated.

The most common combination is that of two price series: We long one asset and simultaneously
short another asset, with an appropriate allocation of capital to each asset. This is the familiar “pairs trading”
strategy. But the concept of cointegration easily extends to three or more assets. 

There are two common cointegration tests: the CADF(suitable only for a pair of price series) and the Johansen test
(applicable to any number of series)
